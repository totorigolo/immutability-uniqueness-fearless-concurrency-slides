	The paper presents a \textbf{type system} to \textbf{restrict updates}
	to memory to prevent (some) race conditions.\\
	~\\
	They provide a novel combination of \textbf{immutable} and \textbf{unique}
	(isolated) types that ensure \textbf{safe parallelism} (race freedom and
	deterministic execution).
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Compile-time race-freedom guarantee}

	\newcommand{\bbb}{\only<5->{\color{blue}}}
	
	Reference immutability is based on a set of permission-qualified
	types. The system has four qualifiers:
	\begin{itemize}
	\pause
	\item \textbf{writable:} An ``ordinary'' object reference, which
		  allows {\bb mutation} of its referent.
	\uncover<4->{
	\item \textbf{readable:} A read-only reference, which allows {\bbb no
		  mutation} of its referent. Furthermore, no {\bbb heap traversal}
		  through a read-only reference produces a \texttt{writable}
		  reference (\texttt{writable} references to the same objects
		  {\bbb may exist and be reachable elsewhere}, just not through a
		  \texttt{readable} reference). A readable reference may also
		  refer to an immutable object.
	}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Compile-time race-freedom guarantee}
	\newcommand{\bb}{\only<2->{\color{blue}}}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{immutable:} A read-only reference which additionally
		  notes that its referent {\bb can never be mutated through any
		  reference}. Immutable references may be aliased by \texttt{readable}
		  or \texttt{immutable} references, but no other kind of reference.
		  All objects reachable from an \texttt{immutable} reference are
		  also \texttt{immutable}.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Compile-time race-freedom guarantee}
	\newcommand{\bb}{\only<2->{\color{blue}}}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{isolated:} An external reference to an {\bb externally-
		  unique object cluster}. External uniqueness naturally captures
		  {\bb thread locality of data}. An externally-unique aggregate
		  is a cluster of objects that freely reference each other,
	      but for which {\bb only one external reference into the
	  	  aggregate exists}.\\
	  	  All paths to non-immutable objects reachable from the
	  	  isolated reference pass through the isolated reference.
	\end{itemize}
	\texttt{isolated} references must be converted through
	subtyping to another permission before use.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Compile-time race-freedom guarantee}
	The objective now is to assemble a set of rules to:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item control where modifications can occur
	\item guarantee that modifications cannot occur in some situations
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Compile-time race-freedom guarantee}
	For example, a developer can be sure that a library call to a static
	method with the type signature
	\begin{lstlisting}
		int countElements(readable ElementList lst);
	\end{lstlisting}
	will not modify the list or its elements (through the \texttt{lst}
	reference).	Accessing any field of the argument \texttt{lst} through
	the \texttt{readable} reference passed will produce other \texttt{readable}
	(or \texttt{immutable}) references.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Compile-time race-freedom guarantee}
	For example, a developer could not	implement \texttt{countElements()}
	like so:
	\begin{lstlisting}
		int countElements(readable ElementList lst)
		{ lst.head = null; return 0; }
	\end{lstlisting}
	because the compiler would issue a \textbf{type error}. In fact,
	\textbf{any	attempt} within \texttt{countElements()} \textbf{to modify}
	the	list would result in a \textbf{type error}, because \texttt{lst} is
	\textbf{deeply (transitively) read-only}, and writes through read-only
	references are prohibited.
	\vfill
	\textit{This can remind you of the \texttt{const} modifier in C++.}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Compile-time race-freedom guarantee}
	The \texttt{isolated} permission is a novelty of this work, and
	is particularly important for two reasons.\\
	\pause ~\\
	\textbf{First}, they support natural safe parallelism. Here, threads
	cannot interfere with each other, because they work on distinct memory
	locations.
	\begin{lstlisting}
		isolated IntList l1 = ...;
		isolated IntList l2 = ...;
		{ l1.map(new Incrementor()); }
			|| { l2.map(new Incrementor()); }
	\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Compile-time race-freedom guarantee}
	\textbf{Second}, as the whole object graph behind an isolated reference
	is only accessible though an \textbf{unique} reference, it can be
	converted to other permissions, like \texttt{writable}, at once.
	\vfill
	\begin{center}
		\frame{\includegraphics[width=7cm]{uml/isolated-clusters.png}}
	\end{center}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Compile-time race-freedom guarantee}
	The paper provides a set of subtyping rules (remember, it's a type
	system). Here are a few:
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Compile-time race-freedom guarantee}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item it is impossible to acquire a \texttt{writable} reference to
	      an \texttt{immutable} type.
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{lstlisting}
		immutable IntList l = generateRange(0, 100);
		
		// default permission is writable
		IntList mutRef = l; // <- this is forbidden, type error!
		
		mutRef.set(2, -1);
	\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Compile-time race-freedom guarantee}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{isolated} references must be converted before any use,
	      and such a conversion is \textbf{destructive}.
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{lstlisting}
		isolated IntList l = ...;
		
		// update l's permission to writable
		writable IntList l2 = l;
		
		print(l2.get(3)); // ok
		
		l.head = ...; // Type Error!
	\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Compile-time race-freedom guarantee}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{immutable} and \texttt{isolated} references can be
	      recovered under conditions.
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{lstlisting}
		isolated IntBox increment(isolated IntBox b) {
			// implicitly convert b to writable
			b.value++;
			
			// convert b *back* to isolated
			return b;
		}
	\end{lstlisting}
	Is it safe?
	\only<3->{
