Fearless concurrency, or how can the compiler save us?
======================================================

Here are a few slides I've made for a paper presentation for the
DD2443 course at KTH (Parallel and Distributed Computing - Pardis 18).

The paper I'm presenting briefly is: (see `bibliography.bib` for full citation)
```
Uniqueness and Reference Immutability for Safe Parallelism
Gordon, Colin S. and Parkinson, Matthew and Parsons, Jared and Bromfield, Aleks and Duffy, Joe
October 2012 - Microsoft Research
```

Do not hesitate to make a PR if you see anything wrong! :)
